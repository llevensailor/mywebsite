Each country has a different way of reporting air pollution levels. According to Wikipedia, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) created the Air Quality Index (AQI) that is based on the five pollutants: ground-level ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. The six levels of public health concerns are pictured below.\n\n\n\nAir Quality Index\n\n\nSeveral datasets were used in this project.\n\nThe dataset containing AQI scores for the United States can be found here\nThe dataset containing AQI scores for the rest of the world can be found here"

To fix this issue Leah decided to create a separate figure (Figure 4) for the United States, separated by the average AQI of each state. Looking at the individual states first, the trends seem to be the more south west you go, the worse the AQI gets. California has the worst AQI in the United States on average which is due to the constant wildfires and the overpopulation which causes high vehicular emissions. On the flip side, Alaska has one of the best AQI scores on average partially due to the less densely populated areas. The entire country as a whole hovers around the 35 area. Now looking at the countries in North and South America the scale has changed. The range for the AQI for the United States is roughly 20-55, but the range for the America continents is roughly 25-200 so on the national range, the United States would have a relatively low AQI. All of the countries are within the 50-100 range except Chile which has a score of over 200. According to Un Dispatch, the reason for this is because the majority of people in Chile heat their homes via wood burning which creates a lot of air pollution."

For example a result in a best-of-3 round has a value of 0 for the value4, value5, and average fields.\nPositive values depend on the event; see the column “format” in Events.\n\nMost events have the format “time”, where the value represents centiseconds.

This dataset provides information about institutions as a whole and also specific fields of study in the United States. This data was produced by federal reports by institutions, financial aid data, and tax data. Specifically, we are focusing on post secondary institutions in Massachusetts in 2021. Our guiding question is in Massachusetts in 2021, are private, non profit, or public schools thriving in terms of student popularity? To investigate this broad topic, we look at the data from private, non profit, and public post secondary schools data including their number of undergraduate students and their admissions rate.\nOur first plot looks at the relationship between average number of students and type of institution. The graph is split into three separate bars for each institution type: public, private non-profit, and private for-profit. We can conclude from this graph that typically the public institutions in Massachusetts have a higher number of students with an average of 3480 students per institution. The outlier is the Private For-Profit average number of students with 151 students. This number is brought down by the smaller specialized schools such as Empire Beauty School-Boston with only 87 people in the undergraduate population. The public universities in this graph don’t show a great discrepancy between the public and private non-profit institutions but in reality, there is such a large gap between the largest and smallest number of students in all of the public universities. The average is brought down by all of the smaller public schools. Our second plot looks at the relationship between admissions rate and number of undergraduate students, colored by the status of private, non profit, and public institutions. From this graph, we observe that for public institutions, the vast majority have a very high admission rate but hover around an average number of undergraduate students enrolled. This implies that public colleges/universities are relatively popular, as they admit a large number of students while having an average number of undergraduates enrolled. For private institutions, they are evenly spread along the admission rate, while remaining comparable numbers of undergraduate enrollment. We conclude from this information that since these colleges and universities have a similar number of undergraduates as public institutions, but often lower admission rates, they are more popular than public institutions.\nThe key takeaway from our analysis is that public institutions have larger student populations than private or nonprofit institutions, indicating a level of popularity, but have higher admission rates, indicating a possibility of less popularity in terms of applicant pool. The data collected for this dataset is those institutions that receive federal funding. The institutions collect their own data, and may have different ways of doing so, possibly leading to different reports and non-standardized data collection. This data also provides financial information in terms of the institution to families and applicants, but not the culture or surroundings of the college itself, including city or town living expenses."

These data were recorded and published by the World Cube Association. The data includes information about the location of the competitions, the ranks of the competitors at different levels, the home countries of the competitors, and the gender of the competitors. We were specifically looking at competitions using a standard 3 by 3 Rubik’s Cube. We were interested in exploring the breakdown of gender for competitors from each continent, and the total number of competitors from each continent. Originally, we attempted to look at a breakdown of competitors by country, but these data contain information about competitors from so many countries that it became difficult to look at in a graph form. Thus, we decided to change our question to look at gender by continent instead. This required some data wrangling to match each country to its corresponding continent. The wrangling resulted in a bar graph showing the breakdown of competitors for each continent, colored based on gender. Asia had the most competitors (over 80,000), then North America, then Europe, then South America, then Oceania, and finally Africa (under 5,000). From the bar graph it was immediately apparent that there were more male competitors than female competitors. This was true for each continent. We then decided to display the data in another way, so we made two pie charts. The first pie chart shows the breakdown of which continent the female competitors came from (in blues). The second pie chart shows the breakdown of which continent different male competitors came from (in reds). Key takeaways from our data wrangling and plotting show that across all continents more male competitors attend Rubik’s competitions, and more competitors come from Asia than any other continent, both male and female. When we join datasets we need to consider what new information can be gleaned from combining the data. For example, if we have one dataset with people’s names and how much money they spend on milk, and another set with people’s names and addresses, combining those datasets could lead to targeted ad campaigns, which would not be possible with either one of the datasets by itself. In the case of this dataset, you could use the date and address of the competitions, combined with the names of the competitors attending to find where and when a person was in a location – which could potentially be an invasion of privacy."
