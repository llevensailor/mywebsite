## Bio 
I am currently studying at Smith College with a double major in [Computer Science](https://www.smith.edu/academics/computer-science) and [Statisical Data Science](https://www.smith.edu/academics/statistical-data-sciences). I have known for a long time I wanted to work in some sort of Computer Science field, using technology to enhance the human experience and help those who are underprivileged and overlooked. Whether that be working on technology for amputees or speech devices for children with developmental disabilities I have always wanted to make a difference using the skills I have. 

On top of that, my love for Data Science and Statistics came as a surprise after high school when I couldn't seem to escape the little voice in my head telling me to take these classes. Along the same vein, I want to use my knowledge to help people and give people information and statistics that can truly better their lives. My work with the Vascular Research Lab at Smith College is helping me achieve that goal. When I am not doing coursework, you can typically find me building a new LEGO set or learning a new skyle such as crocheting. Anything to keep my hands busy and my brain engaged.
